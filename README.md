## README File: Wellesley Housing Simulator
# About
This project models the Wellesley Housing selection process. It takes the user's input of where they want to live (i.e. which Residence Hall and what type of room) and then gives them all available outputs. 

This was completed by scanning the PDF file containing the data of available rooms at Wellesley and adjusting the format. Then, we read in the file and assign each room to its own Room object, organized into lists based on room type (RoomCollections, where room type is single, double, triple, etc.) and held in Building objects based on their locations.

# How to Use
To use our project, clone the repository on your machine. Open and run the SimulateHousing.java file. When prompted, input your preferences for location and room type to see the available rooms.
